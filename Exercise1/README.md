# Exercise1: Basic Bank Account

In this exercise, we create a basic bank account application as part of the Zero To Mastery Java curriculum.

## Exercise Description

The exercise requires creating a package and class structure for a bank account application. We need to create a `BankAccount` class with three fields: `accountNumber` (int), `accountHolder` (String), and `balance` (double). Additionally, we create a `Main` class inside the `main` package to test our implementation.

## Progress

- [x] Completed the exercise without encountering any issues.
- [x] Implemented the `bank` package structure and created the `BankAccount` class.
- [x] Created the `main` package structure and implemented the `Main` class.
- [x] Imported the `BankAccount` class into the `Main` class.
- [x] Created a `BankAccount` object and set values for its fields.
- [x] Printed the field values to the console for verification.

## Learnings

During this exercise, I learned how to:

- Create a package structure to organize classes in Java.
- Declare and initialize class fields.
- Import classes from different packages.
- Create objects using the `new` keyword.
- Access and print field values in the console.

## Bonus

During the course of this exercise, I went beyond the requirements and implemented the following additional features:

- Implemented user interaction using the `Scanner` class, allowing users to enter their name and desired password during runtime to create a personalized bank account.
- Generated a random 8-digit account number for each new account created, enhancing security and uniqueness.
- Saved the account information, including account number, account holder name, hashed password with salt, and initial balance, to a file named "accounts.txt" for future access and record-keeping.

### Learning - Bonus Features

In this bonus section, I learned how to:

- Utilize the `Scanner` class to read user input in Java.
- Implemented random 8-digit number generation.
- Implement password hashing with salt using the PBKDF2 algorithm for enhanced security.
- Generate and use random salts to protect against dictionary attacks.
- Save data sequentially to a named file for persistent storage.

## Next Steps

I will proceed to the next exercise and continue practicing Java programming concepts.
